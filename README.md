It's hard work to organzie your books! However, what if you can create an online librabry and all you have to do is enter an ISBN code. In this project, we will be entering a designated ISBN code for each book. Once you enter in this code, you get back the book title, book uthor, an image of the book, the prce of the book, and if it available or not. Each ISBN will be parsed into a book object that is created in the book class.

import java.util.Scanner; // scanner for importation 

public class BookClutter {

//variables
private String bookAuthor;
private String bookTitle; 
private Int bookPrice;
private Boolean available;

/* If the plan is to import a file with ISBN codes 
	public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException {  //add 'throws IOException" to handle errors
    String row; //variable in regards to line 13. reading the rows of the people in the list
    ArrayList<Person> party = new ArrayList<Person>(); //rather a string or an Integer, create a list of Person objects 
     //begin code given by mr. twyford
    BufferedReader csvReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("names.csv"));  //make sure file is in same folder (or use folder path in name
      while ((row = csvReader.readLine()) != null) {
          String[] data = row.split(",");
          }

public int takeISBN {
 Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); // creates instance of keyboard scanner
System.out.println("Hello!! Welcome to the online library!");
System.out.println("Would you like to find a book? Enter the ISBN code!");
Int ans = keyboard.nextInt(); //takes in the answer
