# Java_API

Implement a version of the Java Google Books API
https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client-samples/blob/master/books-cmdline-sample/src/main/java/com/google/api/services/samples/books/cmdline/BooksSample.java

Imagine you are trying to declutter your books...but you don't want to just throw them away! Create a program where you enter the ISBN of a book, and the title and author of each book is returned to you. 

Each ISBN will be parsed into a book object, created from the book class.
